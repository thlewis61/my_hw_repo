**Overall:** Good work, and you definitely didn't go overboard! I appreciated you keeping in the previous modeling work you had done too. Once the modeling homework is up, we can talk about some other methods/algorithms for you to try out to solve this problem! As I had mentioned, I know this homework felt introductory, but these basic questions to establish a Problem Statement, Hypotheses, Analysis Plans, Assumption, etc. are key.

**Some notes**

* **Part 2 - Q.6** Your statement is well posed, but it is a bit closer to a hypothesis than a 'problem statement.' While a hypothesis serves as a claim that you will investigate in order to validate said claim, think of a problem statement as more of a goal for your investigation as a whole. In other words, your goal under your hypothesis is to investigate if there is a relationship between the prestige of undergraduate institution, GRE, and GPA of a grad school applicant and their likelihood of being admitted.
* **Part 3 - Q.2a** You have made some very acute observations regarding 'clean' data sourcing and sampling bias! These are critical pieces to statistical analysis and experiments in order for any analysis to be valid. However, be careful with definitions of distributions. We assume that the data is approxametely 'normally distributed' not necessarily 'standard normally distributed'. Remember:

Standard Normal $\implies X\sim N(0,1)$
and Normal $\implies X\sim N(\mu,\sigma)$   

* **Part 3 - Q.3a, Q.3b, Q.4** Please ensure that you complete this questions! You should think about how outliers can impact your analysis of distributions (think mean, median, skew, kurtosis, etc.) and always keep statistical tests, in addition to graphical/visual analysis, in mind when testing for distributions, outliers, or any other hypothesis. And as far as the Analysis Plan goes, think about the steps you just took, and will take for HW2, and how you could write these out to ensure that a collegue could reproduce them.
